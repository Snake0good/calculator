# Calculator
Here is my repo for the JavaScript basic calculator. 

The initial calculator worked, but I wasn't pleased with how I built it. I started using arrays because I felt very comfortable with them (coming from Python and the numpy library). So, I re-did it and made the beefy calc. Much happier. 

Reduced <code>javascript</code> from <b>160</b> -> <b>65</b> lines

No tutorials. It makes me proud to say that.
